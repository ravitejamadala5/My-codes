BMP085 is a python based library for measuring barometric pressure and temperature.

With BMP085 we could get the functionality where we can use temperature and pressure
as our parameters to further calculate or print the required parameters from any of
them.

First we initialize bmp to BMP(0X77), Here 0X77 is the stnadrad default value.
Here by intialiasing bmp to BMP(0x77) ,we by default do debug=True.

We can also specify the operating modes by setting the parameters as
  -0
  -1
  -2
  -3

  Here 0 is for ULTRALOWPOWER modes
    -  1 is for STANDARD modes
    -  2 is for HIRES modes
    -  3 is for ULTRAHIRES mode

    Now we get tempreature as bmp.readTemperature().
    This function reads the temperature and store it in temp variable.

    Now we get pressure as bmp.readPressure().
    This function reads the Pressure and store it in pressure variable.

    Now we get altitude as bmp.readAltitude().
    This function reads the Altitude and store it in altitude variable.

    At last we are printing all the variables which are storing the parameters
    that are temperature, pressure and altitude respectively.

    The print is done by using the format specifiers of float type
    upto 2 precision value and the units are specified at the end of each print
    statement.
